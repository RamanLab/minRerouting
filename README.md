# minRerouting
Package to understand the compensatory mechanisms performing similar metabolic functions through analysis of Synthetic Lethals

# Alternate Routes in Networks
The rerouting of the reaction fluxes in the metabolic network to produce an essential function seems to be non-trivial and involves complex structrues. This package helps to identify minimal rerouting corresponding synthetic lethal pairs using constraint based tools like MOMA.
