## Comparing synthetic lethals classification by Güell et al (2014)

This excercise attempts to analyse and comparer the classification of lethals as proposed by [Güell et al (2014)](http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003637#s4). The hypothesis is that synthetic lethals can be classified into plasticity and redundancy subtypes in metabolic networks. 

Classification:
