## Comparing synthetic lethals classification by G端ell et al (2014)

This excercise attempts to analyse and comparer the classification of lethals as proposed by [G端ell et al (2014)](http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003637#s4). The hypothesis is that synthetic lethals can be classified into plasticity and redundancy subtypes in metabolic networks. 

### Classification:
* Plasticity SL (PSL) pairs, with one reaction functional and one silent in the WT
* Redundancy SL (RSL) pairs, with both reactions active

This classification was based on the optimal FBA solution to maximize biomass growth rate. Metabolic constraints define a range of solution space. FBA is a based on linear programming approach to identify a particular solution maximizing given objective function, generally biomas  gorwth rate. Even though the solution space is reduced, FBA picks one of the solutions satisfying optimal growth. `optimizeCbModel` function in COBRA toolbox can be used to find such FBA solutions with additional objectives such as `minNorm`. We here compare several FBA solutions found using several minNorm conditions as well as different solvers.

#### Synthetic Lethals Pairs
We enlist synthetic lethal pairs identified using **Fast-SL** and as reported by G端ell et al (2014).
